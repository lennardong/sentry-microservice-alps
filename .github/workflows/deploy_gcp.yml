    steps:

    # STEP 1 (load the repo)
    # This step checks out your code repository into the GitHub Actions runner environment. 
    # The runner is a virtual machine that is provisioned to run your CI/CD workflow. 
    # It is necessary to checkout the repository so that the runner has access to your code and can perform the required actions, 
    # such as building the Docker image, running tests, or deploying your application.
    
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    # Step 2 (Set up Python): 
    # This step sets up the specified Python version (3.8 in the example) in the runner environment. 
    # Since your application is written in Python, it is necessary to have Python installed in the runner.
    # This is to execute commands such as pip install or run any Python scripts.

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    # Step 3 (Install dependencies): 
    # This step installs the dependencies specified in your requirements.txt file using the make install command. 
    # It is necessary to install these dependencies to ensure that the application has access
    # to all the required libraries and packages when running tests, building the Docker image, or deploying the application.

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        cd app-container
        make install
    
    # STEP: Auth w GCP 
    # This is a GitHub Actions expression that retrieves the value of the secret named GCP_SA_KEY from the GitHub repository's secrets.
    # Then, it authenticates it with GCP
